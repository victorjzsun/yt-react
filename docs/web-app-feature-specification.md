## Current Implemented Features

### 1. Playlist Management

#### 1.1 Add Videos to Playlist
**Description:** Core functionality that automatically adds new YouTube videos to specified playlists.

**User Interaction:**
- User enters a Playlist ID in Column A of the spreadsheet (format: `PLxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
- Playlist IDs can be found in YouTube playlist URLs after `?list=`
- Multiple playlists can be managed by adding rows

**Expected Outcome:**
- New videos from specified sources (channels, subscriptions, playlists) are automatically added to the target playlist
- Only videos published after the last update timestamp are added
- Maximum 200 videos per execution (quota limit protection)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses YouTube Data API v3 `PlaylistItems.insert()`
- Handles API errors (404 for private videos, 409 for duplicates)
- Cannot add to Watch Later or Watch History playlists (API limitation)

---

#### 1.2 Timestamp-Based Updates
**Description:** Tracks last update time to prevent duplicate video additions and manage incremental updates.

**User Interaction:**
- Column B (Last Update Timestamp) automatically populated on first run
- Initial timestamp set to 24 hours before first execution
- User can manually edit timestamp to control date range of videos to add
- Timestamp format: ISO 8601 with timezone (e.g., `2024-01-24T13:22:53.000-05:00`)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Only videos published after the timestamp are processed
- Timestamp automatically updates after successful execution
- Prevents adding entire channel history on first run

**Edge Cases:**
- Debug flag `debugFlag_dontUpdateTimestamp` prevents updates during testing
- Manual timestamp editing allows backfilling historical videos (up to 200 video limit)

---

#### 1.3 Scheduled Update Frequency
**Description:** Controls how often each playlist is automatically updated.

**User Interaction:**
- Column C (Frequency hours) - user enters number of hours between updates
- Empty value = update every execution
- Positive number = minimum hours before next update
- Works with hourly time-driven triggers set in Apps Script

**Expected Outcome:**
- Script checks if enough time has passed since last update
- Skips playlist update if frequency interval not met
- Logs "Skipped: Not time yet" when interval not reached

**Technical Details:**
- Calculation: `dateDiff = Date.now() - lastTimestamp`
- Comparison: `nextTime = frequency * MILLIS_PER_HOUR`
- Update if: `dateDiff > nextTime`

---

#### 1.4 Auto-Delete Old Videos
**Description:** Automatically removes videos from playlist after a specified number of days.

**User Interaction:**
- Column D (Delete days) - user enters number of days
- Videos older than this many days are removed from playlist
- Based on video's original publication date, not when added to playlist
- Empty or 0 = no deletion

**Expected Outcome:**
- Videos published more than N days ago are removed from playlist
- Duplicate videos (same videoId) are also removed during this process
- Helps keep playlists fresh and manageable

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `YouTube.PlaylistItems.remove()`
- Compares `item.contentDetails.videoPublishedAt` to `deleteBeforeTimestamp`
- Also checks `publishedBefore` parameter in API call

---

### 2. Video Source Management

#### 2.1 Channel ID Input
**Description:** Add videos from specific YouTube channels by channel ID.

**User Interaction:**
- Columns F onwards - user enters channel IDs
- Format: `UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (24 characters starting with UC)
- Multiple channels per playlist by adding to adjacent columns
- Channel ID found in channel URL: `youtube.com/channel/UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Expected Outcome:**
- All new videos from specified channels are added to playlist
- Videos must be public (private videos trigger 404 but don't cause errors)
- Uses channel's uploads playlist for efficiency

**Technical Details:**
- Validates channel exists using `YouTube.Channels.list('id')`
- Retrieves uploads playlist: `results.items[0].contentDetails.relatedPlaylists.uploads`
- Filters videos by publication date

---

#### 2.2 Username Input
**Description:** Add videos from channels using legacy YouTube usernames.

**User Interaction:**
- Columns F onwards - user enters username (any string not starting with "UC", "PL", or "ALL")
- Username from URL: `youtube.com/user/someusername`
- Script automatically resolves username to channel ID

**Expected Outcome:**
- Username is converted to channel ID via API
- Videos from that channel are added to playlist
- Error logged if username doesn't exist or is ambiguous

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `YouTube.Channels.list('id', {forUsername: channel})`
- Validates exactly one result returned
- Note: Custom URLs (`youtube.com/c/customname`) are NOT supported

---

#### 2.3 ALL Keyword (Subscription Auto-Add)
**Description:** Special keyword to add videos from all user's YouTube subscriptions.

**User Interaction:**
- Enter `ALL` (case-sensitive) in any channel column
- One `ALL` keyword processes all subscriptions for that playlist
- Most popular feature for creating a "master" playlist

**Expected Outcome:**
- Script retrieves all channels user is subscribed to
- New videos from all subscriptions are added to playlist
- Supports up to 1000 subscriptions (API pagination limit)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `YouTube.Subscriptions.list('snippet')` with pagination
- 50 results per page, max 20 pages
- Workaround for nextPageToken API bug (hardcoded token list)

---

#### 2.4 Playlist Mirroring (Playlist ID Input)
**Description:** Mirror/copy videos from another playlist into target playlist.

**User Interaction:**
- Columns F onwards - user enters playlist ID
- Format: `PLxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (starts with PL, length > 10)
- Useful for combining multiple playlists or mirroring community playlists

**Expected Outcome:**
- New videos added to source playlist are copied to target playlist
- Only videos added after last timestamp are copied
- Allows creating aggregated playlists from multiple sources

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `YouTube.PlaylistItems.list('snippet')` 
- Filters by `publishedAfter` timestamp
- Validates playlist exists before processing

---

### 3. Execution and Control Features

#### 3.1 Manual Playlist Update
**Description:** Trigger immediate update of all playlists via Google Sheets menu.

**User Interaction:**

**Expected Outcome:**
- All playlists in spreadsheet are processed sequentially
- Timestamps updated on success
- Errors logged to Debug sheet
- Execution completes or throws error with count of failed videos

**Technical Details:**
- Entry point: `updatePlaylists(sheet)` function
- Iterates through rows starting at `reservedTableRows` (row 3, 0-indexed)
- Uses `errorflag` to prevent timestamp updates on errors

---

#### 3.2 Scheduled Time-Driven Updates
**Description:** Automatically run updates on a recurring schedule using Apps Script triggers.

**User Interaction:**
- Apps Script Editor > Triggers tab > Add Trigger
- Select: `updatePlaylists` → `Time-driven` → `Hour timer` → `Every hour` (or other interval)
- Requires sheet ID stored in Script Properties

**Expected Outcome:**
- Script runs automatically without user intervention
- Frequency controls in Column C prevent excessive API usage
- 6-minute execution timeout for time-driven triggers (vs 30 minutes manual)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()` to retrieve sheet ID
- `onOpen()` function stores sheet ID on first manual run
- Opens sheet by ID: `SpreadsheetApp.openById(sheetID)`

---

#### 3.3 Web App Deployment
**Description:** Deploy script as a web application for viewing playlists and triggering updates.

**User Interaction:**
- Deploy from Apps Script Editor: `Deploy` > `New Deployment` > `Web app`
- Access via deployment URL with query parameters:
  - `?update=True` - force update all playlists before displaying
  - `?pl=N` - display Nth playlist (1-indexed, user-facing numbering)
  - Combined: `?update=True&pl=3` - update and show 3rd playlist

**Expected Outcome:**
- Opens HTML page with embedded YouTube playlist player
- Shows selected playlist in iframe
- Can trigger updates without opening spreadsheet
- Includes bookmarklet for removing watched videos from playlist

- Playlist selected via `playlist(pl, sheetID)` helper function

---

### 4. Debug and Error Handling

#### 4.1 Debug Logging System
**Description:** Comprehensive logging system that captures execution details for troubleshooting.

**User Interaction:**
- Hidden sheet `DebugData` stores raw logs
- Visible sheet `Debug` displays formatted logs
- Column A shows timestamps, Column B shows log messages
- Cell B1 controls number of executions to display

**Expected Outcome:**
- Every script execution logged with timestamp
- Errors, warnings, and info messages captured
- Logs organized chronologically
- User can review historical executions

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `Logger.log()` for all messages
- `Logger.getLog()` retrieves logs for current execution
- Cyclic column usage: 900 rows per column, 26 columns total
- `getLogs(timestamp)` function retrieves logs for specific execution

---

#### 4.2 Error Handling and Reporting
**Description:** Robust error handling that logs issues without stopping entire execution.

**User Interaction:**
- Errors logged to Debug sheet
- Script continues processing remaining playlists after errors
- Final error count thrown if any videos failed to add
- Timestamps not updated for rows with errors

**Expected Outcome:**
- User can identify which playlists/channels have issues
- Script doesn't fail completely due to one bad channel ID
- Error messages include API details for troubleshooting

**Technical Details:**
- `addError(s)` function logs error and sets `errorflag`
- Row-level: `errorflag` prevents timestamp update
- Playlist-level: `plErrorCount` tracks errors per playlist
- Script-level: `totalErrorCount` determines if exception thrown

---

#### 4.3 Debug Flags
**Description:** Developer flags to test script behavior without modifying playlists or timestamps.

**User Interaction:**
- Set at top of `sheetScript.gs` file
- Must be manually edited in Apps Script Editor
- Not exposed to end users in current interface

**Available Flags:**
```javascript
debugFlag_dontUpdateTimestamp = false   // Prevent timestamp changes
debugFlag_dontUpdatePlaylists = false   // Dry run - don't add videos
debugFlag_logWhenNoNewVideosFound = true // Verbose logging
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- `dontUpdateTimestamp`: Can re-run script with same timestamp for testing
- `dontUpdatePlaylists`: See what would happen without actual changes
- `logWhenNoNewVideosFound`: Identify inactive channels

**Use Cases:**
- Testing channel ID validity
- Verifying API quota usage
- Debugging timestamp logic

---

### 5. Quota Management

#### 5.1 Video Limit (200 videos per execution)
**Description:** Hard limit to prevent YouTube API quota exhaustion.

**User Interaction:**
- No direct user control
- Script refuses to add more than 200 videos at once
- Error logged: "Script cannot add more than 200 videos"

**Expected Outcome:**
- Prevents quota overflow
- User must adjust timestamp to smaller date range if exceeded
- API quota: 10,000 units/day default

**Technical Details:**
- Check in `addVideosToPlaylist()`: `if (totalVids > maxVideos)`
- Variable: `maxVideos = 200` (adjustable at top of script)
- YouTube API costs: Search = 100 units, Playlist operations = 50 units

---

#### 5.2 Quota-Efficient Video Retrieval
**Description:** Two methods for retrieving videos, with different quota costs.

**User Interaction:**
- No user control - automatically uses efficient method
- Alternative method available if needed: `getVideoIds()` (commented in code)

**Current Method: `getVideoIdsWithLessQueries()`**
- Uses channel's uploads playlist
- Cost: 3 units per channel
- Slower but quota-efficient
- Date ordering less precise

**Alternative Method: `getVideoIds()` (not used)**
- Uses YouTube Search API
- Cost: 100 units per channel
- Faster, better date ordering
- Higher quota consumption

**Expected Outcome:**
- Default method conserves quota
- Can process more channels per day
- Trade-off: slightly slower execution

---

### 6. Playlist Maintenance

#### 6.1 Duplicate Video Removal
**Description:** Automatically removes duplicate videos (same videoId) from playlists during deletion process.

**User Interaction:**
- Automatic during delete operation (Column D)
- No user configuration required
- Runs whenever delete days feature is used

**Expected Outcome:**
- Only one instance of each video remains in playlist
- Keeps playlists clean
- Reduces playlist clutter from re-added videos

**Technical Details:**
- Implemented in `deletePlaylistItems()` function
- Uses JavaScript array filtering to find duplicates

---

#### 6.2 Private Video Handling
**Description:** Gracefully handles private, deleted, or unavailable videos.

**User Interaction:**
- No user action required
- Script detects and logs private videos
- Error count not incremented for private videos

**Expected Outcome:**
- Private videos don't cause script failures
- Log message: "Cannot find video, most likely private"
- Script continues processing other videos

**Technical Details:**
- 404 error caught during `YouTube.PlaylistItems.insert()`
- Validates with `YouTube.Videos.list('snippet')` to confirm video doesn't exist
- Special handling: `errorCount` does not increase for private videos

---

### 7. Additional Utilities

#### 7.1 Remove Videos from Playlist (Bookmarklets)
**Description:** JavaScript bookmarklets to manually remove videos from playlists in YouTube's web interface.

**User Interaction:**
- Documented in `removeVidsFromPlaylist.md`
- Create browser bookmark with JavaScript code
- Click bookmarklet while on YouTube playlist page

**Available Bookmarklets:**
1. Remove all videos
2. Remove all watched videos
3. Remove specified number of videos
4. Remove videos matching keyword/regex

**Expected Outcome:**
- Bulk playlist management in YouTube UI
- Workaround for YouTube's lack of bulk delete features
- Useful for manual cleanup tasks

**Technical Details:**
- Bookmarklets inject JavaScript into YouTube page
- Query DOM for playlist video elements
- Simulate clicks on menu buttons
- May break if YouTube HTML structure changes

---

#### 7.2 Timezone Configuration
**Description:** Set script's timezone for accurate timestamp handling.

**User Interaction:**

- Change `timeZone` field to desired timezone code
- Use timezone codes from Google's list

**Expected Outcome:**
- Timestamps in logs match user's local time
- Correct ISO date strings with timezone offset
- Affects `Date.toIsoString()` custom prototype

**Technical Details:**
- Requires `appsscript.json` visible in editor settings
- Format: `"timeZone": "America/New_York"`
- Custom date prototype extends JavaScript Date object

---

#### 7.3 Script Update Mechanism
**Description:** Process for updating to latest script version.

**User Interaction:**
- Two options:
  1. Get new sheet copy and transfer data
  2. Replace Code.gs content in Apps Script Editor

**Expected Outcome:**
- User has latest features and bug fixes
- Existing data and configuration preserved (option 2)
- Triggers and deployments remain intact (option 2)

**Considerations:**

**Status:** Requested (Enhancement)  
**Opened:** Oct 3, 2018

**Description:** Handle premiere videos that appear in feed before they're watchable.

**User Need:**
- Premieres show up hours before actual premiere time
- Adding them early creates unwatchable playlist entries
- Users want videos added only when watchable

**Proposed User Interaction:**
- Setting: "Delay adding premieres until [X] minutes after scheduled time"
- Or: Automatically detect and defer

**Expected Outcome:**
- Premiere videos detected and held back

**User Need:**
- Shorts are different format (vertical, < 60 sec)
- Not suitable for playlist viewing experience
- Users want traditional videos only

**Current Implementation:**
- Column E labeled "Shorts? (No)"
- Implementation status unclear from code review

**Proposed Enhancement:**
- Ensure robust Shorts detection
- Boolean toggle per playlist
- Could combine with duration filter

**Technical Considerations:**
- Shorts detected by duration (< 60 seconds)
- No explicit "shorts" flag in API
- Must fetch `contentDetails.duration`

---

### Medium Priority - Operational Features

#### F6. Add Videos Between Two Dates (#129)
**Status:** Requested (Enhancement)  
**Opened:** Apr 10, 2024

**Description:** Specify date range (start and end) for videos to add, rather than just "after timestamp".

**User Need:**
- Backfill historical videos from specific time period
- Create retrospective playlists
- More control than single timestamp

**Proposed User Interaction:**
- Additional column: "End Date/Timestamp"
- Videos added if: `Start Date <= Published Date <= End Date`
- Empty end date = no upper limit (current behavior)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Videos from specific date range added to playlist
- Can create "Best of 2023" type playlists
- Multiple runs with different ranges possible

**Technical Considerations:**
- Add `publishedBefore` parameter to API calls
- May need to increase `maxVideos` limit for large ranges
- Consider quota implications

---

#### F7. Limit Number of Videos to Import per Channel (#76)
**Status:** Requested (Enhancement)  
**Opened:** May 8, 2020

**Description:** Set maximum number of videos to add per channel per execution.

**User Need:**
- Some channels upload frequently (multiple videos per day)
- Prevents one prolific channel from dominating playlist
- Better balanced playlist across all channels

**Proposed User Interaction:**
- Global setting: "Max videos per channel: [number]"
- Or per-playlist setting
- Default: unlimited (current behavior)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Maximum N videos added per channel, per execution
- Oldest videos prioritized (by publish date)
- Subsequent executions add remaining videos

**Technical Considerations:**
- Slice video array per channel: `videoIds.slice(0, maxPerChannel)`
- Timestamp still updates to latest check time
- May need per-channel timestamp tracking for full solution

---

#### F8. Catch and Restore Videos on Quota Error (#52)
**Status:** Requested (Enhancement)  
**Opened:** Jan 31, 2020

**User Need:**
- Quota errors cause partial updates
- Lost progress frustrating
- Want graceful degradation

**Proposed User Interaction:**
- Automatic - no user action required
- Notification when quota limit hit
- Resume on next scheduled run

**Expected Outcome:**
- Quota error caught and logged
- Videos pending addition saved
- Next execution continues from saved state
- No duplicate additions

**Technical Considerations:**
- Store pending videos in Script Properties or separate sheet
- Quota error detection: `e.message` contains "quota"
- Resume logic: Check for pending videos before normal execution
- Complex state management

---

#### F9. Automatically Add and Delete Script Triggers to Bypass Timeout (#54)
**Status:** Requested (Enhancement)  
**Opened:** Feb 8, 2020

**Description:** When script approaches 6-minute timeout, schedule continuation trigger and exit gracefully.

**User Need:**
- Time-driven triggers limited to 6 minutes execution
- Large channel lists or many playlists may exceed limit
- Current workaround: manual trigger with 30-minute limit

**Proposed User Interaction:**
- Automatic - no user intervention
- Setting: "Enable automatic continuation" (default: on)
- Status indicator: "Processing... (page 2 of 3)"

**Expected Outcome:**
- Script monitors execution time
- At 5:30, saves state and creates new trigger
- New trigger runs shortly after (e.g., 2 minutes)
- Process continues until completion

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use `ScriptApp.newTrigger()` to create time-based trigger
- Save current row index in Script Properties
- Delete trigger after continuation completes
- Risk: Trigger accumulation if not cleaned up properly

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness Requirements

**Must Support:**
- Smartphones (320px - 768px width)
- Tablets (768px - 1024px width)
- Desktop (1024px+ width)

**Responsive Behaviors:**
- Stack cards vertically on mobile
- Collapse sidebar navigation to hamburger menu
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px tap target)
- Simplified forms on small screens
- Progressive disclosure even more important on mobile

---

### 6. Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance:**
- Keyboard navigation for all functions
- Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- Error messages associated with form fields
- Skip navigation links
- Resizable text without breaking layout

---

### 7. Authentication & Authorization

**Current State:**
- OAuth through Google Apps Script
- Requires YouTube Data API scope
- Spreadsheet access scope

**Web App Requirements:**
- Same OAuth flow
- Session management
- "Not authorized" state handling
- Clear re-authorization process
- Privacy policy link
- Terms of service

---

### 8. Performance Considerations

**Loading States:**
- Show spinner during API operations
- Indicate which playlist is being updated
- Progress bar for bulk operations
- Don't block UI during background operations

**Caching:**
- Cache playlist info client-side
- Refresh on user action or periodically
- Show stale data with indicator while refreshing

**Optimization:**
- Lazy load playlist details
- Paginate long lists
- Defer loading of advanced features until accessed

---

### 9. Error Handling & User Feedback

**Error Display:**
- Toast notifications for temporary messages
- Inline validation errors on forms
- Dedicated error view for critical failures
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Help links for common errors

**Success Feedback:**
- Confirmation messages for all destructive actions
- Success toasts for completed operations
- Updated UI state to reflect changes
- "Undo" option where applicable

---

### 10. Data Migration from Sheet to Web App

**Challenge:** Users currently configure in Google Sheet.

**Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1:** Web app reads from existing sheet structure
2. **Phase 2:** Web app can write back to sheet (maintains compatibility)
3. **Phase 3:** Option to use web app's own storage (Apps Script Properties or Firebase)
4. **Phase 4:** Deprecate sheet interface (optional)

**Benefits:**
- Gradual migration path
- No forced breaking changes
- Users can choose interface
- Sheet remains as backup/advanced tool

---

### 11. Documentation Integration

- FAQ section
- Video tutorials (embedded or linked)
- Sample configurations

**External Documentation:**
- Comprehensive web docs
- API reference
- Troubleshooting guide
- Community forum links

---

### 12. Future Extensibility

**Plugin Architecture (Future):**
- Custom filter functions
- Third-party integrations
- Community-contributed features
- API for programmatic access

**Settings Import/Export:**
- JSON format for configurations
- Share configurations between users
- Version control for configurations
- Templates marketplace (future)

---

## Design Principles Summary

### 1. **Simplicity First**
Default view should be usable by non-technical users with minimal explanation.

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
Advanced features hidden until needed, revealed through clear navigation.

### 3. **Fail Gracefully**
Errors don't break entire system, clear recovery paths provided.

### 4. **Preserve User Intent**
Safeguards against accidental data loss, confirmations for destructive actions.

### 5. **Performance Matters**
Respect API quotas, optimize for speed, provide feedback during long operations.

### 6. **Accessible to All**
Follow WCAG guidelines, support keyboard navigation, work on all devices.

### 7. **Backwards Compatible**
Maintain support for existing Google Sheet configurations during transition.

### 8. **Community-Driven**
Address real user pain points from GitHub issues, gather ongoing feedback.

## Technical Architecture Recommendations

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React or Vue.js (component-based, good for progressive disclosure)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Material-UI (responsive, accessible)
- **State Management:** Context API or Vuex
- **Build Tool:** Vite (fast, modern)

### Backend
- **Platform:** Google Apps Script (maintain existing infrastructure)
- **Web App:** HTML Service with client-side JavaScript
- **API:** Expose Apps Script functions via `google.script.run`
- **Storage:** Continue using Google Sheet as database initially

### Data Flow
```
User Browser
    ↓ (HTTPS)
Google Apps Script Web App
    ↓ (Apps Script API)
Google Sheet (configuration storage)
    ↓ (read/write)
Apps Script Backend (sheetScript.gs logic)
    ↓ (YouTube Data API v3)
YouTube
```

### Alternative Future Architecture
```
User Browser
    ↓ (HTTPS)
Firebase Hosting (web app)
    ↓ (HTTPS API calls)
Google Cloud Functions
    ↓ (Firestore for config)
Firebase Firestore
    ↓ (Cloud Scheduler triggers)
Cloud Functions (execution logic)
    ↓ (YouTube Data API v3)
YouTube
```

**Benefits of Cloud-based:**
- Better performance
- More flexible storage
- Easier to scale
- Modern development workflow

**Drawbacks:**
- Migration complexity
- Cost (Firebase/GCP not free after limits)
- More complex deployment
- Moving away from "just copy a sheet" simplicity

## Conclusion

This specification documents **25 current features**, **13 requested enhancements**, **3 critical bugs**, and **12 additional complementary features** for a total of **53 feature items** to consider in the web app redesign.

The proposed 4-tier progressive disclosure UI pattern will allow all features to be supported while maintaining simplicity for basic users. By categorizing features into Core, Common, Advanced, and Admin tiers, the interface can scale gracefully without overwhelming any user segment.

Key design priorities:
1. Maintain backwards compatibility with existing Google Sheet configuration
2. Implement most-requested filters first (Shorts, upcoming, member-only)
3. Create mobile-responsive, accessible interface
4. Provide clear path from simple to advanced usage
5. Preserve existing quota management and error handling
6. Enable future extensibility through modular architecture

This specification should provide sufficient detail for an AI coding agent to create initial interface mockups and implementation plans for the new web application.
